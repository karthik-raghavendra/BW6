Hi,

An update,
I was able to solve the Issue by using <delimiters>, and when I used % as the token, as below.

	<build>
	    <plugins>
		<plugin>
		    <groupId>com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin</groupId>
		    <artifactId>replacer</artifactId>
		    <version>1.5.2</version>
		    <executions>                
			<execution>
			    <phase>prepare-package</phase>
			    <goals>
				<goal>replace</goal>
			    </goals>                    
			</execution>
		    </executions>
		    <configuration>
			<delimiters>
			  <delimiter>%</delimiter> 
			</delimiters>
			<file>${inputFile}</file>
			<tokenValueMap>DEV_properties.txt</tokenValueMap>
			<outputFile>${outFileName}</outputFile>
		    </configuration>
		</plugin>
	    </plugins>
	</build>

The could change the input file containing tokens
	 <field>
	     <name>HTTP/Server</name>    
	     <value>%Server%</value>
	 </field>

to

	 <field>
	     <name>HTTP/Server</name>
	     <value>QA_Application_Server11</value>
	 </field>

as expected.

I would have loved to have ${Var} changed as mentioned in the problem.
But this solves the requirement.

When I specified the delimiter as below, somehow it is not working.
		  <delimiter>${}</delimiter>

Thanks again for the suggestions provided.
