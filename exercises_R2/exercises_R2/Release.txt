Hi,

Please find attached the maven POMs, to build and deploy tibco projects.

This release adds the following features to the previous Release.
+ The key feature of token replacement to generate deployment XML file is complete. The 'pom_configXML_Replace.xml' uses token tokenValueMap  feature of Maven to search & replace variables enclosed within # #, to their values, if it is defined in the properties file in the form.
variable=value
+ Used variable for the commands defined in the poms, to enhance portability.
  Variables are defined in settings.xml, in the DEV profile. Similarly we can have different profiles for each environment.
+ Using file separator, to make the POMs portable. I tried in some POMs and it is working. This has to be implemented in 3-4 POMs.

Some of the things, that has to be done, which I can think of on the top of my mind.
1. Addition to version control.
2. Add versioning support in the POM files.
3. Add encryption so that the POM files can be released as a password protected jar file. This will ensure the Maven code is not seen.
4. Jenkins Integration.

I have tried to make it portable to Linux. The use of the file separator should facilitate this.
However, there might be some changes to the POMs.

Code review has not been done. Nagashree helped me in some of the POCs for execution of commands and in token replacement.

Aniket, we can have a session to walk you through the code.

Thanks
-Raghu
